#What can it do for you?


##### 1. Handle all complicated things about Search & Parse the weather data.

You can search place by using `-(void)getPlacemarksFromString:(NSString*)string completion:(SmileWeatherPlacemarksCompletion)completion`, the completion block return array of the `CLPlacemark`.

```
[[SmileWeatherDownLoader sharedDownloader] getPlacemarksForSearchDisplayFromString:@"cupertino" completion:^(NSArray *placeMarks, NSError *error) {
        if (!error) {
            //search results: array of placemark in here
        }
    }];
```

For example, you can get weather data by using `-(void)getWeatherDataFromPlacemark:(CLPlacemark*)placeMark completion:(SmileWeatherDataDownloadCompletion)completion;`, the completion block return well formed weather data `SmileWeatherData`.

```
[[SmileWeatherDownLoader sharedDownloader] getWeatherDataFromPlacemark:placemark completion:^(SmileWeatherData *data, NSError *error) {
        if (!error) {
            //Well formed weather data in here.
        }
    }];
```
