#What can it do for you?


##### 1. Handle all complicated things about Search & Parse the weather data.

For example, you can get weather data by using `-(void)getWeatherDataFromLocation:(CLLocation*)location completion:(SmileWeatherDataDownloadCompletion)completion`, in completion block get well formed weather data.

```
    CLLocation *location = [[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:37.322998 longitude:-122.032182];
    [[SmileWeatherDownLoader sharedDownloader] getWeatherDataFromLocation:location completion:^(SmileWeatherData *data, NSError *error) {
        if (!error) {
            //Well formed weather data in here.
        }
    }];
```

##### 2. Need not any weather icon. Using climatically pictographs [climacons font](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/), return the corresponding character that is used for weather icon.

##### 3. Fully localized all the things (weather information, timestamp, weekday, timezone, etc) for almost all the countries in the world.
